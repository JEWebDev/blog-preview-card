## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that you don't need media queries for responsive typography just use clamp().

```css
.how-to-use-clamp {
  font-size: clamp(min, prefered, max);
}
```

Using clamp scales the font size with only one line of css.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about responsive web design and other use cases for clamp().

### Useful resources

I used MDN for the documentation about the clamp method.
